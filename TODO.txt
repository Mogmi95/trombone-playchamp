Ideas for what to do next:

# Kinda important

* An actual menu with game modes selection and a cool art (we probably can have like PLAY, AUTOPLAY, CREDITS, (EXIT?) right now... settings might be better in the ingame settings?)
* Check notes' Y instead of only the current X check
* Improve note checking to *feel* better/fairer
* Summary screen after ending a song (score, number of hit/miss, quality of hits...)
* Highscore storing/display?

# Cool stuff

* Improve the font/display of success messages (might as well make them optional in the ingame settings?)
* Improve the style of the player bar
* Improve the score look/animation(s)
* Try to have rounded bars for notes that change pitch (maybe using `gfx.drawArc`, shouldn't impact perfs)
* Particle effects when hitting a note
* Have an animation somehow in the "background" while playing? Or something happening.
* Display lyrics if they are presents in the `.tmb` file
* Propose alternative instruments?
